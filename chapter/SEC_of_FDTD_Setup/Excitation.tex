\section{Excitation signal setup} \label{sec:FDTD_Excitation}
An excitation  is a source of the  electric magnetic field. It can be  simulated by an electrical field intensity $\vec{E}$ or a magnetic field intensity $\vec{H}$. In OpenEMS, each excitation can be considered as a composition  of two parts -- a signal of  time (or  frequency) as well as  a geometrical distribution  in the space. The first part is called excitation signal here.
In Matlab this signal is defined as a field of the structure \matv{FDTD}, which is named as \matv{Excitation}. \phantomsection \label{para:Excitation}%\matv{Excitation}

This section will show how to set up  an \matv{Excitation} using different signal, such as a Gaussian pulse, a sinusoidal signal or other custom excitation signal\footnote{How to apply the \matv{Excitation}  to geometrical distribution in the space  is showed in the section \ref{sect-Primitives}.}:

       \end{myindentpar}
Note that Gaussian and sinusoidal excitation can be  defined in frequency domain in the above functions, because signals in time domain or frequency domain can be transformed into each other.\\
\info{One  simulation uses only one excitation signal.
If many excitation signals are involved during a simulation, superposition principle can be utilized to  attain the equivalent simulation.}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% subsection Gaussian pulse %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \subsection{Gaussian pulse} \label{subsec:Gaussian pulse}
If $f_0$ is a modulated frequency and $f_c$ is a bandwidth  from   $f_0-0.5f_c$ to  $f_0+0.5f_c$ where the excitation amplitudes  are greater than $-5$dB, a time domain Gaussian signal (Indeed it's a pure Gaussian signal modulated by a co-sinusoidal signal. See fig. \ref{fig:GaussInpulseTheory})
\begin{equation}\label{equ:GussianSignal_time}
 f(t)=cos[2\pi f_0(t-t_0)]e^{-{\big(\frac{t-t_0}{\frac{t0}{3}}\big)}^2}, \quad \text{for } t>0 \text{ and }t_0=\frac{9}{2\pi f_c}
\end{equation}
can be transformed  into frequency domain as
\begin{equation}\label{equ:GussianSignal_freq}
F(f)=\frac{3}{4\sqrt{\pi}f_c}e^{-j\frac{9f}{f_c}}e^{-{\big(\frac{f-f_0}{\frac{2f_c}{3}}\big)}^2},\quad \text{for } f>0 .
\end{equation}

Figure \ref{fig:GaussInpulseTheory} shows an instance of Gaussian pulse from expressions \ref{equ:GussianSignal_time} and \ref{equ:GussianSignal_freq}.

According to the expression \ref{equ:GussianSignal_freq}, a Gaussian signal can be defined using function \hyperref[func:SetGaussExcite]{\texttt{SetGaussExcite()}}.

      \end{lstlisting}
\end{FontDescr}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Description
\begin{FontDescr}{Description:}
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% f0
    \begin{FontPara}{f0} \phantomsection \label{para:f0}
   \matv{f0}  is the frequency of the modulating co-sinusoidal signal. It's also the central frequency of the Gaussian signal. With \matv{f0} the signal has the highest amplitude or energy.
    \end{FontPara}
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% fc
    \begin{FontPara}{fc} \phantomsection \label{para:fc}
		\matv{fc} determines the variance of the signal. It is a  bandwidth of which center is at \matv{f0}. In the band [\matv{f0}-0.5\matv{fc} \quad \matv{f0}+0.5\matv{fc}] the amplitude  is greater than  $-5$dB (See fig. \ref{fig:GaussInpulseTheory}).
% The maximal frequency which will be simulated is \matv{f0}+\matv{fc}.
The broader \matv{fc} is, the less steep is the signal in frequency domain, but narrower  and steeper the signal is in time domain.
    \end{FontPara} 
\end{FontDescr}

\warning{ Small \matv{fc} for narrow band will lead to a time-consuming simulation. Great \matv{fc} for broadband will lead to a  signal  in short time. }
