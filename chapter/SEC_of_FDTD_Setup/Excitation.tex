\section{Excitation signal setup} \label{sec:FDTD_Excitation}
An excitation  is a source of the  electric magnetic field. It can be  an electrical field intensity $\vec{E}$ or an magnetic field intensity $\vec{H}$. And  in OpenEMS, each excitation can be considered as a composition  of two parts -- a signal of  time or  frequency as well as  a distribution or an application in the space. The first part is called excitation signal here. And in Matlab it is defined as one field of the structure \hyperref[para:FDTD]{\texttt{FDTD}}, which is named as \texttt{Excitation}. \phantomsection \label{para:Excitation}\\%\hyperref[para:Excitation]{\texttt{Excitation}} 

This section will show how to set up an \hyperref[para:Excitation]{\texttt{Excitation}} such as a Gaussian pulse, a sinusoidal signal or other customs excitation signals,\footnote{How to apply the \hyperref[para:Excitation]{\texttt{Excitation}}  to any given space(meshes or grids) is showed in the section \ref{sect-Primitives}.} with the following functions:
       \begin{myindentpar}
	      \hyperref[func:SetGaussExcite]{\texttt{SetGaussExcite(FDTD,f0,fc)}} \\ 
	      \hyperref[func:SetSinusExcite]{\texttt{SetSinusExcite(FDTD,f0)}}\\ 
	      \hyperref[func:SetCustomExcite]{\texttt{SetCustomExcite(FDTD,f0,funcStr)}}
       \end{myindentpar}
Note that Gaussian and sinusoidal excitatian are defined in frequency domain , since signals in time domain or frequency domain can be transformed into each other.   More Details are showed in the following subsections \ref{subsec:Gaussian pulse}, \ref{subsec:Sinousoidal signal} and \ref{subsec:Other excitation signals}\\
Exact definetion of these excitation signals can be found in the source codes file: \textasciitilde/openems/openEMS/FDTD/excitation.cpp.\\
\info{One  simulation has one excitation signal. 
And if many excitation signals are involved in a case, superposition principle can be utilized to  attain the equivalent simulation.}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% subsection Gaussian pulse %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \subsection{Gaussian pulse} \label{subsec:Gaussian pulse}
If $f_0$ is a modulated frequency and $f_c$ is a bandwidth between  two cutoff frequencies $f_0-f_c/2$ and  $f_0+f_c/2$ at -5dB, then a time domain Gaussian signal (a pure Gaussian signal modulated by a co-sinusoidal signal)
\begin{equation}\label{equ:GussianSignal_time}
 f(t)=cos[2\pi f_0(t-t_0)]e^{-{\big(\frac{t-t_0}{\frac{t0}{3}}\big)}^2}, \quad \text{for } t>0 \text{ and }t_0=\frac{9}{2\pi f_c}
\end{equation}
can be expressed  in frequency domain as
\begin{equation}\label{equ:GussianSignal_freq}
F(f)=\frac{3}{4\sqrt{\pi}f_c}e^{-j\frac{9f}{f_c}}e^{-{\big(\frac{f-f_0}{\frac{2f_c}{3}}\big)}^2},\quad \text{for } f>0 .
\end{equation}

Figure \ref{fig:GaussInpulseTheory} shows an instance of Gaussian pulse from expressions \ref{equ:GussianSignal_time} and \ref{equ:GussianSignal_freq}.

	      \label{fig:GaussInpulseTheory}
    \end{figure}
According to the expression \ref{equ:GussianSignal_freq}, a Gaussian signal can be defined with function \hyperref[func:SetGaussExcite]{\texttt{SetGaussExcite(FDTD,f0,fc)}}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% FUNCTION  SetGaussExcite %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\textcolor{blue}{\begin{large}\textbf{SetGaussExcite}	\end{large}}\phantomsection \label{func:SetGaussExcite}\\
	  Set a Gaussian function as the signal of the excitation.

\textcolor{blue}{\begin{large}Syntax:\end{large}}
 \begin{lstlisting}

 \end{lstlisting}

\textcolor{blue}{\begin{large}Definition:\end{large}}\\
      This function update the structure \hyperref[para:FDTD]{\texttt{FDTD}} with the expression \ref{equ:GussianSignal_freq}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% f0
	\texttt{f0}  \phantomsection \label{para:f0} %\hyperref[para:f0]{\texttt{f0}} 
	    \begin{myindentpar}
		\hyperref[para:f0]{\texttt{f0}}  is the frequency of the modulating co-sinusoidal signal. It's also the central frequency of the Gaussian signal. At this frequency the signal has the highest amplitude or energy. 
	    \end{myindentpar}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% fc
	\texttt{fc}  \phantomsection \label{para:fc} %\hyperref[para:fc]{\texttt{fc}} 
	    \begin{myindentpar}
		\hyperref[para:fc]{\texttt{fc}} determines the variance of the signal. It is a central bandwidth. In the band [\hyperref[para:f0]{\texttt{f0}}-\hyperref[para:fc]{\texttt{fc}}/2 \quad \hyperref[para:f0]{\texttt{f0}}+\hyperref[para:fc]{\texttt{fc}}/2] the signal is greater then about -5dB. See figure \ref{fig:GaussInpulseTheory}. And the maximal frequency to be simulated is \hyperref[para:f0]{\texttt{f0}}+\hyperref[para:fc]{\texttt{fc}}.The greater \hyperref[para:fc]{\texttt{fc}} is, the flater is the signal in frequency domain, but cliffier and shorter in time domain.
	    \end{myindentpar}
\warning{Too small \hyperref[para:fc]{\texttt{fc}} will lead to a time-consuming simulation. Too great \hyperref[para:fc]{\texttt{fc}} will lead to a signal in a very short time relative to a time step. Both cases should be advoided.}
