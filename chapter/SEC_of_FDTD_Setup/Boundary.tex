    \subsubsection{Equations of boundary conditions}\label{subsubsec:Equations of BC}
	  Boundary conditions (BC) are necessary for solving the  Maxwell's equations by FDTD. They can limit the computation in a finite space but attaining the same solution just as in a infinite one.  \\
	  The following equations are the general boundary conditions at an arbitrary interface of two medium. And there can be  charges (denoted as charge density $\rho_s$) or  currents (denoted as surface electric current density $\vec{\mathbf{J}}_s$ and  surface magnetic current density $\vec{\mathbf{M}}_s$) at the interface:
	  %%%%% BC EQ
	      \begin{eqnarray}
		  \hat{n}\cdot(\vec{\mathbf{D}}_2-\vec{\mathbf{D}}_1) &=&\rho_s  \\
		  \hat{n}\cdot(\vec{\mathbf{B}}_2-\vec{\mathbf{B}}_1) &=&0  \\
		  \hat{n}\times(\vec{\mathbf{E}}_2-\vec{\mathbf{E}}_1) &=&-\vec{\mathbf{M}}_s \\
		  \hat{n}\times(\vec{\mathbf{H}}_2-\vec{\mathbf{H}}_1) &=&\vec{\mathbf{J}}_s
		  \label{eq:General boundary conditions}
	      \end{eqnarray}

    \subsubsection{Four particularly useful types of boundary conditions in OpenEMS}\label{subsubsec:Four particularly usefull BC}
	Under some special given conditions or assumptions, the boundary conditions(\ref{eq:General boundary conditions}) have  respective forms and they are convenient for the most simulations. These BC are called as perfect electric conductor (\textbf{PEC}), perfect magnetic conductor (\textbf{PMC}), \textbf{MUR} absorbing boundary condition and perfectly matched layer (\textbf{PML}) absorbing boundary condition. More details of these four types of BC are  given in the following subsections (\ref{subsec:PEC}, \ref{subsec:PMC}, \ref{subsec:MUR} and  \ref{subsec:PML}). And the types of these BC are represented as a field of the structure  \hyperref[para:FDTD]{\texttt{FDTD}} in MATLAB. And it's named as \texttt{BoundaryCond}. \phantomsection \label{para:BoundaryCond}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BC
	\texttt{BC}  
\begin{myindentpar}\texttt{BC} provides the types of the boundary conditions to the 6 boundaries of the 3D simulating space.  
          \texttt{BC} is defined either as a \textbf{vector} or as a \textbf{cell} with 6  elements. \vspace{2mm}\\
          If  T\_xmin,T\_xmax,T\_ymin,T\_ymax,T\_zmin and T\_zmax are  arguments which denote for the types of the conditions at the respective boundaries, then \texttt{BC} can be defined as a vector or a cell as following.\vspace{2mm}\\
       %%%%%%%%%%%% vector BC
          \texttt{BC} is defined as a \textbf{vector}
	\begin{myindentpar}

	  \begin{lstlisting}[caption={\texttt{BC} in the form of a vector},label=BCinvector]
 BC=[T_xmin T_xmax T_ymin T_ymax T_zmin T_zmax]; 
	  \end{lstlisting}
          And   each  element(T\_?min or T\_?max)  must be set as one of the following numbers 
	    \begin{myindentpar}
	      \textcolor{green}{\texttt{0}}   \qquad  (represents for PEC)\\
	      \textcolor{green}{\texttt{1}}   \qquad  (represents for PMC)\\
	      \textcolor{green}{\texttt{2}}   \qquad  (represents for MUR)\\
	      \textcolor{green}{\texttt{3}}   \qquad  (represents for PML with 8 layers).

      \end{myindentpar}  
          %%%%%%%%%%%% Cell BC      		                                                                     
          Or \texttt{BC} is defined as a \textbf{cell}

	     \textcolor{green}{\texttt{'PML\_x'}} \qquad   (represents for PML. \texttt{x} is  the PML size. It should be replaced with an integer in an interval from 4 to 50).
	  \end{myindentpar}	
	\end{myindentpar}	
	  So the element \texttt{BC}($i$) or \texttt{BC}\{$i$\} represents for the type of the  condition at the respective boundary as showed in the following table
	  \begin{table}[htb]\centering
	  \begin{tabular}{l|l}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% subsection Perfect electric conductor (PEC) %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \subsection{Perfect electric conductor (PEC)}\label{subsec:PEC}
    \subsubsection{Definition of PEC}
    If one media beside the boundary is theoretically lossless(conductivity $\sigma\rightarrow\infty$, or so called \textbf{perfect conductor}), then the BC can be expressed as
	%%%%% PEC BC EQ
	    \begin{eqnarray}
		\hat{n}\cdot\vec{\mathbf{D}}_1 &=&-\rho_s  \\
		\hat{n}\cdot\vec{\mathbf{B}}_1 &=&0  \\
		\hat{n}\times\vec{\mathbf{E}}_1 &=&0\\
		\hat{n}\times\vec{\mathbf{H}}_1 &=&-\vec{\mathbf{J}}_s .
		\label{eq:PEC boundary conditions}
	    \end{eqnarray}
    \subsubsection{The condition for application of PEC}
    In practice, this BC can be applied where the media  is \textbf{good conductor(e.g., metal)}, because the good conductor can often be seen as nearly lossless(perfect). So condition for using PEC can be summarized as either
    \begin{itemize}
    \item one media is good conductor(e.g., metal) \\
    or
    \item $\sigma\rightarrow\infty$.
    \end{itemize}
