\chapter{FDTD Parameter Setup}\label{chap:FDTD Parameter Setup}
This is a chapter about the proper setup of all necessary FDTD parameter.\\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% FDTD %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\texttt{FDTD}    is a structure in Matlab to describe some parameters of the algorithm FDTD for simulation with OpenEMS. It contains 3 fields: \phantomsection \label{para:FDTD} %\hyperref[para:FDTD]{\texttt{FDTD}}
       \begin{myindentpar}
	      \hyperref[para:FDTD_ATTRIBUTE]{\texttt{ATTRIBUTE}} \\ 
	      \hyperref[para:Excitation]{\texttt{Excitation}}  \\ 
	      \hyperref[para:BoundaryCond]{\texttt{BoundaryCond}}
       \end{myindentpar}
All fields and  their elements  are showed in the figure \ref{fig:Structure FDTD}

Most of these parameters should be assigned with respective functions in MATLAB before a simulation is run in OpenEMS. And this process can be completed step by step. Firstly the structure \hyperref[para:FDTD]{\texttt{FDTD}} should be initiated(see section \ref{sec:FDTD_ATTRIBUTE}), then  \hyperref[para:Excitation]{\texttt{Excitation}} (see section \ref{sec:FDTD_Excitation}) and \hyperref[para:BoundaryCond]{\texttt{BoundaryCond}} (see section \ref{sec:BC}) are set up in the structure.%\hyperref[para:FDTD_ATTRIBUTE]{\texttt{ATTRIBUTE}} has other advanced  parameters of \hyperref[para:FDTD]{\texttt{FDTD}}, such as the type of the coordinates system,  criteria for ending the simulation and so on.
