\chapter{FDTD Parameters Setup}\label{chap:FDTD Parameter Setup}
This is a chapter about  settings of  some parameters for FDTD. These parameters are about end criteria, excitations, boundary conditions, coordinates system, etc.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% FDTD %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
All these parameter settings can be realized through  assignment statement to a structure variable \matv{FDTD} in Matlab by using some predefined functions.
Structure \matv{FDTD} \phantomsection \label{para:FDTD}  includes 3 fields:  
	      \matv{ATTRIBUTE},\phantomsection \label{para:ATTRIBUTE}
	      \matv{Excitation},\phantomsection \label{para:Excitation}
	      and \matv{BoundaryCond}.\phantomsection \label{para:BoundaryCond}

%    \input{svg/FDTD_structure.eps_tex} % this file is from inkscape. saved as with option  omit text and in latex. it has been modified for links.
% Some functions have been defined for user to  assign values to the parameters in \matv{FDTD}.
The functions for setting  \matv{FDTD}  are about:
\begin{myindentpar}[2cm]
initiation of \matv{FDTD} (section \ref{sec:FDTD_ATTRIBUTE}),\\
settings of  excitations (section \ref{sec:FDTD_Excitation}), \\
settings of boundary conditions (section \ref{sec:BC}).
\end{myindentpar}
% EC_FDTD_CYL_THORSTEN\end{myindentpar}
% Most of these parameters should be assigned with respective functions in MATLAB before a simulation is run in OpenEMS. And this process can be completed step by step. Firstly the structure \hyperref[para:FDTD]{\texttt{FDTD}} should be initiated, then  \hyperref[para:Excitation]{\texttt{Excitation}}  and \hyperref[para:BoundaryCond]{\texttt{BoundaryCond}} (see section \ref{sec:BC}) are set up in the structure.%\hyperref[para:FDTD_ATTRIBUTE]{\texttt{ATTRIBUTE}} has other advanced  parameters of \hyperref[para:FDTD]{\texttt{FDTD}}, such as the type of the coordinates system,  criteria for ending the simulation and so on.
